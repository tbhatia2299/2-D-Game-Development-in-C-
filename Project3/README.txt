Project due date: Oct.14 , 2018

Project description: 
1.Convert the while loops into ranged for loops
2.Convert ranged for loops into while loops.
3.Understand Singleton and Scott Meyer's Singleton patterns/
4.Incorporate parallax scrolling. Understanding polymorphism and Inheritance.

Where I got my sprites:
I downloaded my sprites from google and then reshaped using gimp. 
I downloaded the fenrir_wolf sprite (named just wolf in order to make it easy to use here) from https://opengameart.org/content/enemies-and-characters-pixel-art. 
I got the fornite sprite (background) from https://stmed.net/wallpaper-235666 and then downloaded a png image of a suitable size.


How many backgrounds do I have:
2

What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite):
I did not design any sprite.

The easiest part of this project:
Changing for loops to while loops and changing while loops to for loops.
Singleton patterns are easy to understand and implement because Dr. Malloy has taught them so well.


Problems that I had in completing this project:

I had problems in overloading the ioMod as I did not understand what was exactly asked. I had to go to Dr. Malloy's office to solve this problem.
Implementing twowaymultisprite was so time consuming but it helped me a lot to understand the project . It took me so much time to implement it. The first few parts were easy but as I got to the latter parts of the project,
it became a bit more challenging.
