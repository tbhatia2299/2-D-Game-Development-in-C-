Project no: #5

Project due date: 22nd April, 2019

Project description: Incorporate more action and interaction by including projectiles, explosions and object pool. The wolf tries to kill the bats and
                      if the bats touch the wolf, it reappears after being destroyed.

The easiest part of this project: Not much again as with the fourth project.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Object pool and chunks were very time consuming to implement but as with the other projects,
                                                I learnt a lot.I feel that I now I am really close to the final project that I want.

Where did I get my Sound and Music: I will add sound in the last part of the project as I somehow completed majority of it and 
                                    I have two finals on Monday and been really sick lately. I hope Dr. Malloy does not take out too many points 
									for that.

What Objects did I pool:
