Project description: Incorporate a player object
                     Collision Detection and AI using Observer Pattern
                     Include HUD(Heads Up Display) 

The easiest part of this project: Collision Detection and AI using Observer Pattern. I would not say it was easy but 
                                  easier as compared to other parts of the project since Dr. Malloy explained it 
                                  well in the class.
                                 

Problems that I had in completing this project: Including a player object and HUD was something that was difficult. Even
                                                Collision Detection and AI and the concept of smart sprites was difficult.
                                                I took a lot of time to complete the project and it was not easy too but I 
                                                learnt a lot. 

A few sentences describing my proposed project: I want to make the bats shoot at the wolf and make the wolf dodge the bullets
                                                shot by the wolf. Every bullet that hits the wolf makes the health of the wolf
                                                to go down. I wanted to add levels to this project wherein there is a final faceoff
                                                between a wolf and a hunter but I don't know if that is achievable because of the 
                                                time constraint.Wolf spritesheet
